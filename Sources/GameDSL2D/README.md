To implement the DSL for game development using Swift's @resultBuilder function builder attribute, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. Entity: Represents a game entity and manages its components.
2. Component: Represents a game component that defines the behavior or attributes of an entity.
3. System: Represents a game system that processes entities and their components.
4. Game: Represents the overall game and manages shared components and systems.
5. Level: Represents a specific stage or phase within the game and contains level-specific entities, components, and systems.
6. Scenario: Represents a specific configuration or setup of entities within a level.
7. populate modifier: A modifier applied to an Entity declaration to create multiple instances of that entity.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the Swift package.
